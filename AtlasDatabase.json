Additional 9-1-1 calls were received reporting heavy smoke at and near the station. A train stopped after encountering an accumulation of heavy smoke while traveling southbound in a subway tunnel. After stopping, the rear car of the train was about 386 feet from the south end of the subway station platform. Ten minutes later, the OUC operator received a call for medics at the station because people could barely breathe due to the smoke. OUC dispatched a Rail Station Box Alarm to the subway station. Considerations: [1] Due to heavy smoke, responders could not see the train in the tunnel until they were right next to it. [2] Radio communication was sporadic in the subway stations and tunnels. [3] The side door of the train required special keys and would not open for passengers. [4] One person on the train was found unconscious. [5] The following were dispatched: 5 Engine Companies; 2 Ladder Trucks; 2 Battalion Fire Chiefs; 1 Battalion Fire Chief to Operations Command Center; 1 Heavy Rescue Squad; 1 Basic Life Support Unit; 1 Advanced Life Support Unit; and 1 Emergency Medical Services Supervisor. [6] Passengers and pedestrians near the subway station were evacuated. Rescue personnel estimate that the evacuation was completed by 16:25.",
